# University-Course-Management-System  
*University Course Management System by Maan and Hemil*  

## Overview  
The Course Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline university course administration. It provides tools for managing professors, courses, and students while integrating functionalities for viewing and organizing course-related data. This project is implemented in *Python* and utilizes *SQLite* for efficient database operations.  

## Features  

### Database Management  
•⁠  ⁠*Create and manage* an SQLite database (⁠ course_management_system.db ⁠).  
•⁠  ⁠*Insert sample data* for professors, courses, and students.  

### Course Management  
•⁠  ⁠*View all available courses*  
•⁠  ⁠*Fetch detailed course information*  

### Student and Professor Management  
•⁠  ⁠*Manage professor and student records*  

### Query Tools  
•⁠  ⁠*Retrieve course lists, schedules, and professor details*  

### Scalable Design  
•⁠  ⁠*Designed to extend features* like student enrollment and grade tracking.  

## Architecture  
The project follows a *modular structure* with clear separation of concerns:  

•⁠  ⁠*Database Management*: Handles database creation and storage using SQLite.  
•⁠  ⁠*Data Insertion*: Predefined sample data for testing and demonstration.  
•⁠  ⁠*Course Query System*: Retrieve course-related data using SQL queries.  
•⁠  ⁠*Student/Professor Management*: Fetch and display academic user details.

### APIs and Tools  
•⁠  ⁠*SQL Queries*: Used for database management and data retrieval.  
•⁠  ⁠*Datetime*: For handling date-based data.  

## How to Run  
1.⁠ ⁠Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (⁠ University Course Management System.ipynb ⁠) in *Jupyter Lab* or any compatible IDE.  
2.⁠ ⁠Run the cells in sequential order:  
   - *Step 1*: Create the database.  
   - *Step 2*: Insert sample data for professors, courses, and students.  
   - *Step 3*: Query the database to fetch course and professor details.  
3.⁠ ⁠Verify the SQLite database (⁠ course_management_system.db ⁠) is created successfully.  

## Collaboration Tools  
•⁠  ⁠*GitHub*: Version control and project hosting.
